Using nodejs as a local webserver
- For private hosting of compatiable content

Node.js is a javascript runtime environment. It needs specific utilities depending on how the content you're trying to run is built.
Npm is the package manager and tool for nodejs which has utility we can't get out of pacman. Pacman could be used to retrieve dependancies we need that should be available in the AUR eg https://github.com/http-party/http-server & https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nodejs-http-server/.
However installing dependencies the developer has specified with npm will package up for us with npm install. I assume you could find required packages in the NPM directory and get their github repos...
Just install npm alongside nodejs

# sudo pacman -S nodejs
(https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Node.js)

# sudo pacman -S npm
npm is the package manager for node.js

# sudo npm install --global http-server
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start the http-server; open a terminal in the root folder and run 
# http-server

Right click open link on whatever I.P. address it churns out that you can find in the terminal post excecution

Using node as the developer intended

JavaScript is coded in such a way we can see the way the developer has designed their code by checking the package.json file in the root folder (where you also open a termain to run these commands)

# npm install
This will install the dependancies listed under "devDependencies" as specified

# npm run <command>
Commands are listed under "scripts" which show the package + arguments the script employs

There is an upgrade command in "npm update" but it's not like pacman. More research needed here.
