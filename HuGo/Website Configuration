Pathway to install -> configure -> run a Hugo website/server

Source material:
https://gohugo.io/installation/linux/
https://blowfish.page/docs/installation/

--Set up the envrionment--

The packages depended upon are hugo, go and git. Since we already have git installed and configured:
$ sudo pacman -S go
$ sudo pacman -S hugo (note this package is out of date a few versions in the Arch Official Repos vs Github)

Create a new site - go into the folder you want the root website to be in
$ hugo new site "Website Name Commas Include It All"

Add the theme of your choice (blowfish)
Go to github and find a theme then open a terminal in the websites root folder and init it with git
$ git init
Add the theme as a submodule via git
$ git submodule add https://github.com/<theme_author>/<theme_repo>.git themes/<themename>

	-in practice this will look like $ git submodule add https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish

--Configure the site structure--

Delete the config.toml in the root folder

Go into the newly created theme and copy the folder themes/blowfish/config/ and its contents and paste it all directly into the root dir. You'll have the following:
Root/config/_default
├─ config.toml
├─ languages.en.toml
├─ markup.toml
├─ menus.en.toml
├─ module.toml
└─ params.toml

Delete the module.toml & carry on editing the other config files:

~Config.toml

uncomment theme = "blowfish"
uncomment baseURL = "https://arch-ive.github.io/Recipe-Website" [WARNING! This seems to kill the imagepop js]
Delete defaultContentLanguage = "en" inplace for languageCode = "en"

~languages.en.toml
Edit Title
uncomment all the author lines and edit
when you add a link, uncomment the first few and last hash to make the whole string available so it will run
create file&folder for the author image: assets/img/authpic.png

$ hugo server

Icons ------------

Favicons - root/static/
https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/partials/#favicons
https://favicon.io/
download the icons - unzip them - put them in the static folder including the site.webmanifest file

Header icon - root/assets/header
config/_default/languages.en.toml
logo = "header/headericon.png"

Author icon - root/assets/author
same as header in the languages.en.toml; further down:
 [author]
   image = "author/authpic.png"

Background Image ----------
held in root/assets/img/
as bg.img
pointed to in 2 different lines of code (one for lists and one for the homepage in one of the tomls)

NPM & Tailwind-------------
Install the dependencies by going into the theme/blowfish folder with the package.json file and run
$ npm install

then, move up to your root website with
$ cd ../..
And run to compile the CSS:
$ ./themes/blowfish/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/blowfish/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit

then create a new file "package.json" and put in the following so you can npm run server/dev/build

{
  "name": "Code Runners",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "For running scripts",
  "scripts": {
    "server": "hugo server -b http://localhost -p 8000",
    "dev": "NODE_ENV=development ./themes/blowfish/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/blowfish/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit -w",
    "build": "NODE_ENV=production ./themes/blowfish/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/blowfish/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit"
  }
}

Update the submodule------------

# git submodule update --remote --merge
