Installing a local javascript server
 - for private use of 5e.tools, Kobold Fight Club (CSS?) and CubeCobra

Node.js is somesort of framework for javascript environments but needs specific utilities depending on what you want to get done.
Going to use their package manager (npm) instead of pacman but pacman could be used as the server we want is available in the AUR (https://github.com/http-party/http-server / https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nodejs-http-server/)

# sudo pacman -S nodejs
(https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Node.js)

this should make the npm package which is the package manager for node.js which we will use

# npm install --global http-server
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

Start the http-server; open a terminal in the folder with the index file
# http-server

go to: http://localhost:8080/
