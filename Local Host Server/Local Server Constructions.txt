Installing a local javascript server
 - for private use of 5e.tools and any other compatiable content

Node.js is somesort of framework for javascript environments but needs specific utilities depending on what you want to get done.
I'm going to use their package manager (npm) instead of pacman but pacman could be used as the server we want is available in the AUR (https://github.com/http-party/http-server / https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nodejs-http-server/).
However the server needs other dependencies that npm will package up. You could find them in the NPM directory and get their github repos...
Just install npm

# sudo pacman -S nodejs
(https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Node.js)

# sudo pacman -S npm
npm is the package manager for node.js

# sudo npm install --global http-server
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

Start the http-server; open a terminal in the folder with the index file
# http-server
